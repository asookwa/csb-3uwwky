          Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's
          convinced he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the world.
          Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent spirit
          Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he
          never imagined.

              He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
              named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
              served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
              looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
              adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
              girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
              before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping
              lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.

              He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis.
              Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially
              popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story
              created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though
              this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

              An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he
              doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he
              tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d
              rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable
              spork, so he’s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as
              a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.”

              Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing
              a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted
              for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him
              closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more
              daring with her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite
              fond of. She and her sheep were bought along with the lamp not too
              long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the
              dark, which "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The
              lamp comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's
              feet.
